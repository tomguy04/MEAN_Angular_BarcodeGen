Create an application which will present the user a row of colored boxes. 
The colors should be in random order. 
One way to accomplish this is to create an array of random colors in your app.component.ts file and use them with interpolation. 
(You can find color names from https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).

1. create an array or colors (randomized color values)
2. in the css, create a div that is 100 x 100.
2. iterate through the array on the template page, each iteration contains a div and then div gets its color from the element in the array.
